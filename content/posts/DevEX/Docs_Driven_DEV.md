I usually have 3 types of documentation in my projects:

- devlogs (in github), everyone can read, gear more toward developer
- README.md (in github), everyone can read, THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH about the project. The only .md file that allows to exists outside devlogs. How to abcxyz, it can link to files in devlogs for more details (testing, architecture, design decisions,...)
- duylocaldev (locally), may contain secrets, passwords, sensitive notes,...


devlogs
- PROGRESS/INDEX: A file that i wanna open instantly when open the project 
    Contains next, later 

- Overview (Things that are in the code already, not leftovers, plans or ideas)
    - Design decisions 
    - Architecture 
    - Testing 

- Plans: ongoing, whether implemented or not (uncommited of the  above)
- Backlogs: ideas not in plans (not planned to do yet)
